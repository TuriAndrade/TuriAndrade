# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Turi  

ðŸŽ“ Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at **UFMG (DCC)**.  
ðŸ§  Research in **Deep Learning**, with focus on **NLP**, **Computer Vision** and **Healthcare applications**.  
ðŸ’» Enthusiastic about developing AI solutions to tackle **real-world problems**.  
ðŸ“š Currently exploring **Test-Time Adaptation** techniques for both computer vision and healthcare domains. 

## ðŸš€ Projects
- [I-JEPA](https://github.com/TuriAndrade/I-JEPA) â€” I-JEPA with VICReg and Simplicial Embeddings.
- [LGA-ECG](https://github.com/pedroroblesduten/LGA-ECG) â€” A CNN-based Local-Global Self-Attention via Averaged Window Embeddings for Hierarchical ECG Analysis.
- [torch_ddp_utils](https://github.com/TuriAndrade/torch_ddp_utils) â€” Utilities for PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) workflowsâ€”focused on data loading, training, and evaluation in multi-GPU environments.
- [LoRA-SFT](https://github.com/TuriAndrade/LoRA-SFT) â€” Compare **Full Fine-Tuning**, **LoRA**, and **QLoRA** on Dolly-mini using TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, with a simple pipeline for preprocessing, training, and side-by-side evaluation (perplexity + sample generations).
- [RAG](https://github.com/TuriAndrade/RAG) â€” Minimal, low-level **RAG on SQuAD v1.1**: build a FAISS index over MiniLM embeddings, retrieve top-k passages, answer with an extractive QA reader, optionally fine-tune the bi-encoder, and evaluate with EM/F1 plus retriever metrics **(Hit@k, MRR@k, nDCG@k)**.
- [DINOv2-TTA](https://github.com/TuriAndrade/DINOv2-TTA) â€” Modular codebase to evaluate and improve DINOv2 robustness with TTA methods (TENT, EATA, TEA) on ImageNet-C/R, plus scripts to preprocess datasets into a unified HDF5 and config-driven runners for quick, reproducible experiments.
